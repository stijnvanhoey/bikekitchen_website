# Website Fietskeuken Gent


## Development

Setup is powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

### Dev version

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

### Deployment

Site is hosted on server with Apache server and the Sveltekit project is using the `@sveltejs/adapter-static` to convert the project to a static website (which does not need a node server).
